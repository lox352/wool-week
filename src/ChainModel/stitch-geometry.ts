 * The geometry of a single knitted stitch.

 * suggested that shape but had no thickness, no normals to catch light, and
 * was sized so the sprites overlapped rather than interlocked.
 *
 * Built as a tube along a V-shaped curve, so it reads as yarn rather than as
 * a symbol, and sized from the same spacing constants the physics uses so
 * neighbouring stitches meet.
