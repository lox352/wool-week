 * Everything heavy lives behind this one boundary: the chunk itself (three.js,
 * Rapier and the star catalogue) and Rapier's WASM initialisation, which
 * suspends separately once the chunk has arrived. Both are confined to the
 * canvas box so the page around it - title, status line, buttons - renders
 * immediately and never unmounts.
 *
 * The placeholder is exactly the same height as the canvas, so nothing on the
 * page moves when it swaps in.
