/**
 * The body of the hat as knitted: every round at its widest, stacked, in the
 * wool being chosen.
 *
 * Not a chart - a chart is one repeat of one band - but the band a knitter
 * spends most of the hat on, whole, with every yarn in it. Drawn a pixel a
 * stitch and scaled up square, because it is thousands of stitches and is
 * redrawn on every change of wool.
 *
 * Scaled up on the canvas itself, not by the browser: each stitch a square
 * of whole screen pixels, drawn at the strip's own height and the screen's
 * own density, so the picture is shown pixel for pixel. Left to the browser,
 * a one-pixel-a-stitch picture is only kept sharp where it honours
 * `image-rendering: pixelated` for backgrounds; where it doesn't (Safari on
 * a desktop, notably), it is smoothed into a blur.
