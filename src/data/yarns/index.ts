/**
 * Every Shetland wool the site knows how to offer, and where to buy it.
 *
 * Nine hundred and ninety-eight shades from the five spinners whose yarn
 * these patterns are written in - Jamieson's of Shetland, Jamieson & Smith,
 * Uradale, Laxdale and Aister 'oo' - read off their own shops. It does two
 * jobs. Every hat's shades are pinned to an entry here, so one wool is one
 * colour wherever it appears rather than one colour per hat; and a knitter
 * choosing their own can pick out of the whole of it.
 *
 * The colours are estimates sampled from the spinners' product photographs,
 * which is the best anyone outside a dye house has. A photograph of a ball of
 * wool is partly the shadow between its strands, so they run darker than the
 * wool does, and unevenly: some ranges are lit better than others. It is
 * still one method applied to all of them, which is more than the site had
 * before - the same Uradale Graeff was three different colours in three
 * different hats. Where a shade matters, the wool in your hands wins: see the
 * yarn picker.
 *
 * Two spinners in these patterns are not here at all, because they do not
 * sell online in a form that can be read: Foula Wool and the handspun in
 * 2021's fifth colourway. Those shades keep the colours they had.
