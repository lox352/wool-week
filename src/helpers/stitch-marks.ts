 * stroke for a decrease that leans, a three-legged chevron for the centred
 * double decrease, whose middle leg says the middle stitch finishes on top,
 * and the same chevron without that leg for the double decrease that has no
 * middle stitch on top and leans instead.
 * Every mark is symmetric about the middle of its cell, so it lands square
 * whatever size the cell is drawn at.
 *
 * Given as points in a unit cell so the chart can draw them at whatever size
 * it likes, and so nothing here has to know it is being drawn onto a canvas.
