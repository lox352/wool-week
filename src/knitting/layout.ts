 * sits on the middle of the three it took together, and a leaning one on the
 * stitch it leans onto - a k2tog on the right of its two, a k2tog tbl on the
 * left. Read the other way, a KFB keeps its column and the stitch it makes
 * sits beside it, and a make-one picked up between two stitches sits over
 * the gap between them. The columns a decrease gave up are simply left empty,
 * which is what draws the crown as the wedges of absent fabric a printed
 * crown chart shows, and the columns an increase has yet to fill are left
 * empty too, so the rib shows where every new stitch is about to come in.
 *
 * The widest round anchors the grid, at one column per stitch, and everything
 * else is propagated away from it in both directions. That matters because
 * these hats increase above the brim: the Aal Ower Toorie's rib is 130
 * stitches under a 162 stitch body, and working upwards from the rib would
 * have to squeeze 162 stitches into 130 columns. Working down from the body
 * instead leaves the rib spanning the whole chart, which is both true and the
 * thing you want to see coming.
 *
 * It used to hang each stitch above the first stitch it was worked into, with
 * a cursor that only ever moved right. That pinned a short round against one
 * edge - the rib bunched to the right of the chart with dead space beside it -
 * and made the crown's decreases slide sideways rather than closing in evenly,
 * because the gap a decrease leaves always opened on the same side of it.
