/**
 * The knitting-time log: every change of progress, and the page's own
 * comings and goings, appended as they happen and never rewritten.
 *
 * Kept beside a project rather than in it, under its own key, so that a
 * write here never touches the project itself (its "last changed", or the
 * checks that stop two tabs overwriting each other's progress).
 *
 * Each row is small, and relative to the one before:
 *
 *   [seconds since the last row, change in progress]            a tap
 *   [seconds since the last row, change in progress, 1]         an undo
 *   [seconds since the last row, change in progress, 2]         progress that changed
 *                                                               while nothing was
 *                                                               recording: not timed
 *   [seconds since the last row, 0, 10 + event]                 the page: knitting
 *                                                               opened, closed with the
 *                                                               X, loaded, hidden, shown
 *
 * The first row's seconds are since 1970. The page's events aren't read yet;
 * they are kept so that a later reading can use them (the explore branch
 * found them worth most for knitters who only tap at the end of a round).
