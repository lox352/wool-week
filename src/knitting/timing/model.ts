/**
 * How long a hat has taken, and how long it has left, from the log of taps.
 *
 * A tap is rarely one stitch: the big button finishes a run, End of round a
 * round, and the chart can jump anywhere. So the log only ever says that a
 * stretch of stitches was reached at a moment, and everything else is
 * inferred. The approach, chosen by simulation (see the explore branch):
 *
 *   - Each gap between taps is judged against what its stitches should take
 *     at typical costs. Much longer than that, it had a break in it, and its
 *     stitches are credited at the knitter's own pace instead.
 *   - Every gap judged as knitting is also capped at half as much again as
 *     the knitter's pace says, plus two minutes: short breaks hide inside
 *     long gaps, and no tap tells them apart.
 *   - The knitter's pace is a cost per operation (knit, purl, a colour
 *     change, a decrease...), fitted to the gaps by least squares and pulled
 *     towards typical costs while there is little to go on. What is left is
 *     priced at those costs, which knows a crown of decreases or a stretch of
 *     two-colour rounds for what it is.
