 * The chart as paths.

 * the CSS grid this replaced, and it cost about six hundred milliseconds a
 * stitch. But it does not have to be. The hat on the same page draws ten
 * thousand stitches in one call by instancing them, and the equivalent here is
 * that a chart is mostly long runs of one colour: merge each run into a
 * rectangle, and every rectangle of a given yarn into one path, and the whole
 * chart is eight paths and a couple for the rules.
 *
 * Which keeps it vector, so it stays sharp at any pixel ratio and when zoomed
 * or printed - where the canvas it replaces was capped at 2048 pixels a side
 * and so drew at a third of native resolution on a phone.

 * the rib as at the crown. Counting them off each round's own stitches
 * instead would shuffle them sideways every time a round was shaped, which
 * is the opposite of what they are for.
