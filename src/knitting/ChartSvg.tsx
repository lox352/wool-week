 * React is told to leave it alone. Over the top go the two things that do
 * change: how much is done, and which stitch is next.

 * Both are a handful of paths rather than a shape per stitch, because a chart
 * is mostly long runs of one colour. See chart-paths.ts. That is what makes a
 * drawing of ten thousand stitches cheap enough to keep as vectors, which in
 * turn is what keeps it sharp on a phone, under zoom, and on paper.
