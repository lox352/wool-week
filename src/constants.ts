 * How still a hat has to be to count as settled: how far the average stitch
 * moves in a step, as a fraction of its own width.
 *
 * Distance rather than speed, which was measured and not assumed. A settling
 * hat's mean velocity does not fall to nothing - it comes down to a floor and
 * stays there, because the solver's corrections reverse from step to step and
 * so register as speed while going nowhere. On Da Crofter's Kep that floor is
 * 0.167 against a threshold of 0.15, so no amount of running would ever have
 * settled it: at four hundred steps its stitches were moving four
 * ten-thousandths of a width each and it was plainly finished.
 *
 * Distance has no such floor. Three thousandths of a stitch a step is about
 * where the velocity rule used to stop the hats that it did stop, so the
 * shapes are the ones it was already choosing - it is the hats it never
 * stopped that this changes.
